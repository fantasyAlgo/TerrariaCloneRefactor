# Terraria refactor c++/raylib
TODO:
- [x] Solve the lighting system
- [ ] Finish the UI, rotate the tiles, add the empty one (e.g make a rect that points to nothing ), add hearts
- [ ] Style the trees and make the map less dead
- [ ] Make an inventory system
- [ ] Add the possibility to zoom (i guess that's the whole point of this refactor)
- [ ] Make a GUI
