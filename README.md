## Prerequisites
- CMake
- Raylib, Cmake will automatically install it if you don't have it locally
## How to run
This is a cmake project, so as always

git clone https://github.com/fantasyAlgo/TerrariaCloneRefactor.git
mkdir build
cmake ..
build
./TerrariaFake
```
##Â Features
- Lighting, this is made on another thread
- Block placing, you can place and collect blocks, including torches (there are not a lot really)
